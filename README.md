# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10 Challenge

Purpose was to scrape data from several Mars-related sites, compile them into a neat browser

Couldn't check whether my code really works, bc can't get MongoDB installed yet (waiting for ICIT permission)

In the meantime, did the best I could to make it all seem like it would probably work if the db was correctly installed
